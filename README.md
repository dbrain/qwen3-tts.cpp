# qwen3-tts.cpp

## Added In This Fork

> ⚠️ Robot driven guff ⚠️, I pushed ideas/what if's and let the robot (Claude) summon these changes into existence. I'm technically a software engineer but I may as well have been a sentient potato with this fork.
> 
> What I do know:
> - The parent fork was giving me 0.1 RTS, which is surely not everyones experience
> - Pytorch was giving me 0.8 RTS after a bit of fondling
> - faster-qwen3-tts 1.8 RTS on this hardware
> - This fork is now giving me 2.8ish RTS
>
> What it adds that I need for my low low VRAM:
> - Model load/unload/timeout
> - Ability to clone voices using the speaker encoder from base with the VoiceDesign model - either using Base model file or an extracted speaker encoder only (I'll publish at some point~)
> - Streaming with 100-200ms TTFA
> - Ability to save voices in a "probably flakey way that won't survive upgrades"
> - Tried to minimise VRAM - but I don't know I have original numbers anymore - rounding up it's around 3.5GB peak peak
> - Q4_K_M model I'll publish at some point (nothing special, just quanted from F16) drops it to something like 2.2GB peak with TBH a "hard to tell if its worse" quality a bit of a drop RTF (2.8ish -> 2.1ish)

> YMMV, "works well" on my shoddy RTX 3060 12GB / "AMD CPU with a 5 in it" / RAM that I needed to down the frequency of because it kept crashing gaming PC now server that I bought from "some guy on facebook marketplace" when I thought it'd be funny to plan with local LLMs/ASR/.. vision? for a project that apparently now does everything.

This fork ([dbrain/qwen3-tts.cpp](https://github.com/dbrain/qwen3-tts.cpp), paired with [dbrain/ggml](https://github.com/dbrain/ggml)) layers the following on top of [khimaros/qwen3-tts.cpp](https://github.com/khimaros/qwen3-tts.cpp). Headline number on a single RTX 3060 / 12 GB / Ampere: **~2.78× realtime** on Q8_0 (i.e. ~2.78 s of 24 kHz audio per wall-second), measured across the bench suite at peak ~3.35 GB VRAM. Compared to upstream PyTorch + transformers on the same model (BF16), that's roughly **+50 %** end-to-end at single-stream decode.

### Performance

- **wmma `conv_1d_direct` kernel** in dbrain/ggml — single biggest fork-arc jump (RTF 1.87 → 2.61). Tensor-core `nvcuda::wmma` GEMM with on-the-fly im2col index calculation, replacing the im2col-temp + cuBLAS path. **F16 weights only** (vocoder cascade — do not quantise the vocoder beyond F16, that drops the kernel).
- **Fused `GGML_OP_SNAKE` op** (CPU + CUDA) — replaces the `pow(sin(αx), 2) / α + β·x` broadcast chain used at every vocoder residual. Removes a ~10× tensor-broadcast overhead and a `powf` NaN edge case.
- **Q8_0 KV cache for the talker**, paired with the FA prefill path, default ON. Saves ~64 MiB peak VRAM at no measurable RTFA cost. `QWEN3_TTS_KV_Q8=0` reverts to F16 KV.
- **Talker prefill K/V view narrowed** to `round_up(n_past + n_tokens, 256)` per call (vs full `n_ctx`). +8 % realtime-speedup, +13 % t/s.
- **Voice-keyed prefill ICL cache** + per-voice prefill K/V state cache — cold-from-disk TTFA <300 ms.
- **`max_audio_tokens` env-tunable** (default 2048). Higher values cost linear t/s on every synth via FA's full-`n_ctx` scan; expose so ops can pick.
- **Streaming defaults baked in**: `--streaming-batch-size 60`, `--streaming-first-batch-size 1`. Bounds vocoder per-call peak and improves TTFA without throughput regression. Per-request body always wins; envs `QWEN3_TTS_DEFAULT_STREAM_*` override defaults.
- **CUDA graphs disabled by default** (`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS=1`) — at batch=1 autoregressive decode they cost +~700 MiB peak with no measurable gain (talker-step cgraph rebuilds every frame, capture's per-key warmup never converges). `=0` to re-enable for workloads where capture pays off.

### Functionality

- **In-process model lifecycle**: `POST /v1/admin/unload` releases all GPU/CPU buffers; `POST /v1/admin/load` reloads from the captured paths. Idle-unload via `QWEN3_TTS_IDLE_UNLOAD_SECONDS=N` triggers automatic unload after N seconds of synth inactivity, with lazy reload on the next request. Lets a server share a GPU with intermittent workloads.
- **`QWEN3_TTS_LAZY_LOAD=1`** — skip startup model load, defer until first request. Voice-archive scan still runs at startup (host-only). Useful for fast-restart prod compose.
- **C++-owned voice archive** at `$QWEN3_TTS_VOICE_ARCHIVE_DIR`. Each voice is a directory with:
  - `voice.bundle` — primary persistent format (binary `QTVB` magic): speaker embedding + ref_codes + model_id stamp. Atomically written on register; re-validated against the loaded model on startup.
  - `ref_text.txt` — optional ICL transcript.
  - `description.txt` — optional VoiceDesign description.
  - `ref.wav` — optional, kept only for human replay (never read at synth time).
  The WAV is purely the ingest format. Embeds + codes are the durable representation, so a voice survives across model swaps as long as the model_id matches.
- **`voice.warmup`** — persistent on-disk snapshot of the vocoder's ICL warm-up state (causal-conv tails, conv_t overlap buffers, per-layer KV cache) keyed by ref_codes hash. Restored on first synth per voice — eliminates the ~700–1200 ms vocoder warm-up decode that would otherwise run on every cold-from-disk request.
- **Persistent voice caches** — derived voice artefacts (codec embeddings, speaker embeddings) are cached on disk per voice and re-used across restarts.
- **Speaker + codec encoders unloaded after voice register** — they're one-shot pieces, no need to keep their VRAM resident after a voice is registered. The next register lazily reloads them.
- **Speaker-encoder-only GGUF sidecar**: `--speaker-encoder <file>` accepts a tiny GGUF that contains *only* `spk_enc.*` tensors and `qwen3-tts.speaker_encoder.*` metadata. The full Base GGUF (~2.4 GB) carries the entire talker + codec + tokenizer + speaker-encoder, but the running binary only reads the spk_enc subset. The sidecar is **~24 MB** (F16 weights + F32 biases — Q8_0 quantization in the conventional Base GGUF skips the small/odd-shaped speaker-encoder convs anyway). Pair with a VoiceDesign GGUF for a "design + clone" stack at ~3.4 GB peak resident. Extraction script: `scripts/extract_spk_enc.py`. Companion `--hf-repo-se / --hf-file-se` flags auto-download from a HuggingFace repo.
- **Voice-archive C++ ownership** — the archive scanner is in-process (`server.cpp`), not a wrapper. Bundles with `model_id` mismatch are deferred (not deleted) so a model swap doesn't lose voices.
- **`--hf-repo-v` / `--hf-repo-se`** — separate HuggingFace repos for the vocoder and speaker-encoder GGUFs (paired with `--hf-file-v` / `--hf-file-se` overrides for the file within the repo). Lets the server pull a 1.7B-VoiceDesign talker + a 24 MB spk_enc sidecar + a tokenizer in three independent fetches.
- **Input character cap raised** to 6144 (env-tunable via `QWEN3_TTS_INPUT_CHAR_CAP`).
- **C API** (`qwen3tts_c_api.h`) for bindings into non-C++ hosts.
- **`/health` endpoint** + bench-friendly timing log (`-V` / `--print-timing`) splitting prefill, decode steps, and vocoder.

### Required GGML kernels (dbrain/ggml@master, 5 commits ahead of upstream)

| Commit | Op |
|---|---|
| `f9d89c05` | `GGML_OP_SNAKE` (CPU + CUDA), fused `α·sin(βx)² + γx` for the vocoder activation |
| `a8474481` | `GGML_OP_CONV_1D_DIRECT`, smem-tiled CUDA kernel |
| `68a08cbf` | Asymmetric padding API for `conv_1d_direct` + `im2col` `gridDim.y` chunking |
| `963780ac` | Snake powf NaN fix + `conv_1d_direct` early-return sync hazard |
| `963d6660` | tensor-core `wmma` kernel for `conv_1d_direct` (RTF 1.87 → 2.61) |

The submodule pointer in `.gitmodules` references this fork. From upstream `ggml-org/ggml`, both ops and the wmma kernel are non-mergeable as-is (Qwen3-TTS-specific layouts), so they live in the fork.

### A note on "RTF"

This fork (and our up-fork PyTorch reference, [faster-qwen3-tts](https://github.com/qwen-research/faster-qwen3-tts)) reports **RTF as audio-seconds-per-wall-second** (higher is better — 2.78 means we produce ~2.78 s of audio per wall-second of compute). The strict definition (wall / audio, lower is better) is the inverse. We've kept the audio-per-wall convention so numbers compare apples-to-apples with faster-qwen3-tts's bench script.

### Quant ladder on Ampere (RTX 3060) — single-stream decode

| Quant | RTF (audio/wall) | weights VRAM | Notes |
|-------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| Q8_0  | **2.78** | 2316 MiB | fastest — best-tuned MMVQ for batch=1 decode |
| F16   | 2.15 | ~3400 MiB | slower than Q8 *and* fattest; only use if you want unquantised weights for some external reason |
| Q4_K_M | 2.11 | 1000 MiB | only useful when VRAM-bound or on pre-Volta GPUs (Q4_K MMQ is slow on cc=86) |

Don't promote F16 or Q4_K_M to default on Ampere. Q8_0 is the sweet spot.

### Current limitations

- **Vocoder VRAM is fatter than ideal**: 5 of the vocoder's `conv_transpose_1d` ops fall back to CPU because ggml's CUDA kernel only supports F32 weights and the vocoder uses F16. The CPU fallback eats ~158 MiB scheduler memory plus ~110 MiB CUDA-side staging buffers per call. Output is correct, but per-call vocoder peak is ~250 MiB higher than it has to be. The fix is a smem-tiled F16 `conv_transpose_1d` kernel parallel to the existing `conv_1d_direct` wmma kernel; not yet written.
- **24 kHz output only**: a 48 kHz "V2" tokenizer ([takuma104/Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz-48kHz](https://huggingface.co/takuma104/Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz-48kHz)) exists upstream but is not a drop-in: it's a structurally different vocoder (5 decoder blocks instead of 4, codebook_dim 512 instead of 256). Supporting it requires config-driven sizing in `audio_tokenizer_decoder.{h,cpp}` and updates to `convert_tokenizer_to_gguf.py` for V2 tensor names.
- **Speaker-encoder weights are F16-only**: the ECAPA-TDNN encoder dispatches conv layers through the F16-only `conv_1d_direct` path. F32 weights for the speaker encoder aren't supported, but in practice this isn't a quality limitation — the upstream BF16 weights downcast bit-identically to F16 for ECAPA-TDNN-class encoders, and the bias-add op already requires F32 biases (which is what GGUF stores them as).

## Added In Khimaros' Fork

The [khimaros/qwen3-tts.cpp](https://github.com/khimaros/qwen3-tts.cpp) fork layered the following on top of [predict-woo/qwen3-tts.cpp](https://github.com/predict-woo/qwen3-tts.cpp):

- **1.7B model support** with MTP projection bridging the 2048-dim talker and 1024-dim code predictor, plus dynamic model detection
- **ICL voice cloning** via Mimi codec encoder — reference audio is encoded to discrete speech codes and combined with `ref_text` in prefill, as an alternative to x-vector speaker embeddings
- **Voice steering** via `--instructions` flag and server API (1.7B+ only)
- **Multi-language synthesis** via `-l/--language` (en, zh, ja, ko, ru, de, fr, es, it, pt)
- **Proper UTF-8 tokenization** via GPT-2 regex pre-tokenization (fixes tokenization of non-ASCII text)
- **WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE** WAV header support (e.g. macOS screen recordings)
- **GPU-safe vocoder codebook normalization** (unbreaks Vulkan backend)
- **ICL encoder parity fix**: correct conv-layer bias loading (a subtle `sscanf` partial-match bug silently dropped input-conv and resunit biases), raising encoder/Python cosine similarity from ~0.989 to ~0.99999 per stage and eliminating the ~350ms start-of-audio noise in cloned voices
- **Performance optimizations**: flash attention for decode steps, static KV cache with `ggml_set_rows`, cached vocoder decoder graph
- **OpenAI-compatible HTTP server** (`qwen3-tts-server`) with `/v1/audio/speech` and `/v1/audio/voices` endpoints, voice cloning via multipart upload, and `--hf-repo` for auto-downloading GGUFs from the [Qwen3-TTS collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/khimaros/qwen3-tts)
- **Streaming audio output**: chunked vocoder decode with causal tails, per-layer KV rolling, and conv-transpose overlap state, so PCM is emitted frame-by-frame while the transformer is still generating. Exposed via the CLI `--streaming-batch-size N` flag and wired through the server for live HTTP responses; parity-tested against one-shot decode
- **Real token accounting** in `tts_result` (text / prefill / audio tokens, plus prefill time broken out of total generate time) for accurate OpenAI `usage` reporting
- **Multi-variant model support** (Base / CustomVoice / VoiceDesign) with speaker presets and language IDs stored in GGUF metadata
- **Batch model conversion** script that downloads and converts all Qwen3-TTS variants in one shot

### HuggingFace Models

Pre-converted GGUF artifacts are published in the [Qwen3-TTS collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/khimaros/qwen3-tts):

| Repo | Variant |
|------|---------|
| [`khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base-GGUF) | 0.6B, ICL voice clone |
| [`khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice-GGUF) | 0.6B, speaker presets |
| [`khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base-GGUF) | 1.7B, ICL voice clone |
| [`khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice-GGUF) | 1.7B, speaker presets |
| [`khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign-GGUF) | 1.7B, `--instructions` steering |
| [`khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz-GGUF`](https://huggingface.co/khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz-GGUF) | shared vocoder |

Each repo ships F16 and Q8_0 quants. The server auto-downloads and caches them via `--hf-repo`:

```bash
./build/qwen3-tts-server \
    --hf-repo khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice-GGUF:Q8_0 \
    --hf-repo-v khimaros/Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz-GGUF:F16
```

`--hf-repo <repo>[:<quant>]` defaults to `Q8_0`; override the exact GGUF filename with `--hf-file`.

The rest of this README is the original from upstream.

![PyTorch vs qwen3-tts.cpp benchmark](./docs/benchmark_pytorch_vs_cpp.png)

**Benchmark Snapshot (PyTorch vs qwen3-tts.cpp):** Basic 3.19x faster, Clone 4.07x faster. Peak RSS delta: Basic +19.0%, Clone +7.7%.

C++ inference for [Qwen3-TTS](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base) using the [GGML](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) tensor library.

Runs the full TTS pipeline in pure C++17, including text tokenization, speaker encoding, transformer code generation, and vocoder decoding, without Python or PyTorch at inference time.

## Features

- Full text-to-speech pipeline in C++17 with GGML backend
- Voice cloning from reference audio (ECAPA-TDNN x-vector extraction)
- Greedy and sampled decoding (temperature, top-k, repetition penalty)
- GGUF model format (F16 and Q8_0 quantization)
- Runtime backend selection with GPU/Metal preference and CPU fallback
- Deterministic reference tests comparing C++ output against Python
- Compile-time timing instrumentation with zero overhead in normal builds

## Prerequisites

- C++17 compiler (GCC 9+ or Clang 10+)
- CMake 3.14+
- [GGML](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) built from source
- Python 3.10+ with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (model conversion only)

## Quickstart (macOS, copy/paste)

Run these commands from a fresh clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/predict-woo/qwen3-tts.cpp.git
cd qwen3-tts.cpp
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 1) Build GGML with Metal
cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DGGML_METAL=ON
cmake --build ggml/build -j4

# 2) Build qwen3-tts.cpp
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j4

# 3) Create a uv Python environment for setup/conversion tools
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 4) Install Python dependencies
uv pip install --upgrade pip
uv pip install huggingface_hub gguf torch safetensors numpy tqdm coremltools

# Optional if model access requires auth:
# hf auth login

# 5) Download and generate all runtime model artifacts
python scripts/setup_pipeline_models.py

# 6) Basic synthesis example
./build/qwen3-tts-cli \
  -m models \
  -t "Hello from qwen3-tts.cpp running on macOS with CoreML by default." \
  -o examples/readme_example_basic.wav

# 7) Voice-clone example using sample audio in this repo
./build/qwen3-tts-cli \
  -m models \
  -r examples/readme_clone_input.wav \
  -t "This is a voice cloning example generated from the sample audio file in this directory." \
  -o examples/readme_example_clone.wav
```

Expected model artifacts after step 5:

- `models/qwen3-tts-0.6b-f16.gguf`
- `models/qwen3-tts-tokenizer-f16.gguf`
- `models/coreml/code_predictor.mlpackage` (on macOS)

Expected audio outputs after steps 6-7:

- `examples/readme_example_basic.wav`
- `examples/readme_example_clone.wav`

Included voice-clone input/output pair (so users can compare directly):

- Input reference audio: `examples/readme_clone_input.wav`
- Generated output audio: `examples/readme_example_clone.wav`

Audio preview (inline):

- [Play generated output WAV](./examples/readme_example_clone.wav)

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/predict-woo/qwen3-tts.cpp.git
cd qwen3-tts.cpp
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build GGML (vendored in ./ggml)
cmake -S ggml -B ggml/build -DGGML_METAL=ON
cmake --build ggml/build -j4

# Build qwen3-tts.cpp
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j4
```

> **Note:** The top-level CMake currently expects GGML in `./ggml` with libraries under `./ggml/build/src`.

## Model Setup (Recommended)

Use the one-shot setup script:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/setup_pipeline_models.py
```

Useful flags:

- `--force` re-downloads and re-generates all artifacts.
- `--coreml auto|on|off` controls CoreML export behavior.
- `--skip-download` skips HF download and uses existing local model dirs.

## Manual Model Conversion (Advanced)

Convert HuggingFace models to GGUF format:

```bash
# Download the model
hf download Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base \
    --local-dir models/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base

# Convert TTS model (transformer + speaker encoder + tokenizer)
python scripts/convert_tts_to_gguf.py \
    models/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base \
    models/qwen3-tts-0.6b-f16.gguf

# Convert vocoder (audio decoder)
python scripts/convert_tokenizer_to_gguf.py \
    models/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base \
    models/qwen3-tts-tokenizer-f16.gguf
```

Place both `.gguf` files in a `models/` directory.

## Usage

```bash
# Basic synthesis
./build/qwen3-tts-cli -m models -t "Hello, world!" -o hello.wav

# Voice cloning from reference audio
./build/qwen3-tts-cli -m models -t "Hello! How are you?" -r reference.wav -o cloned.wav

# Greedy decoding with max length
./build/qwen3-tts-cli -m models -t "Hello!" -r ref.wav -o out.wav \
    --temperature 0 --max-tokens 2048
```

### CLI Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-m, --model <dir>` | Model directory containing GGUF files | (required) |
| `-t, --text <text>` | Text to synthesize | (required) |
| `-o, --output <file>` | Output WAV file path | `output.wav` |
| `-r, --reference <file>` | Reference audio for voice cloning | (none) |
| `--temperature <val>` | Sampling temperature (0 = greedy) | 0.9 |
| `--top-k <n>` | Top-k sampling (0 = disabled) | 50 |
| `--top-p <val>` | Top-p sampling | 1.0 |
| `--max-tokens <n>` | Maximum audio frames to generate | 4096 |
| `--repetition-penalty <val>` | Repetition penalty on codebook-0 token generation | 1.05 |
| `-j, --threads <n>` | Number of compute threads | 4 |

`--top-p` is currently parsed by the CLI but not yet wired into transformer sampling.

On macOS, CoreML code predictor is enabled by default when `models/coreml/code_predictor.mlpackage` exists.
Set `QWEN3_TTS_USE_COREML=0` to disable it. Low-memory mode is opt-in via `QWEN3_TTS_LOW_MEM=1`.

### Backend Selection

At runtime, each component logs its selected backend (for example, `TTSTransformer backend: MTL0` or `BLAS`).

- Preferred order: `IGPU` -> `GPU` -> `ACCEL` -> `CPU`
- Encoder and transformer can run on Metal/other accelerators with CPU fallback in the scheduler
- Decoder now follows the same backend preference and will use Metal when available

### Source Files

| File | Component | Description |

### TTS Transformer Details

The transformer generates speech codes in two stages per frame:

1. **Talker** (28 layers, 16 heads, 1024 hidden) produces a hidden state and codebook-0 logits.
2. **Code Predictor** (5 layers) autoregressively generates codebooks 1-15 from that hidden state.

The prefill embedding mirrors the Python pipeline exactly:
- Positions 0-2: text-projected role tokens (`<|im_start|>`, `assistant`, `\n`)
- Positions 3-6: TTS pad + codec embeddings (think tokens, language ID)
- Position 7: TTS pad + speaker embedding
- Position 8: TTS BOS + codec pad embedding
- Position 9+: text-projected text tokens + codec BOS/embeddings

## Testing

```bash
# Run full test suite
bash scripts/run_all_tests.sh

# Individual component tests
./build/test_tokenizer --model models/qwen3-tts-0.6b-f16.gguf
./build/test_encoder --tokenizer models/qwen3-tts-0.6b-f16.gguf \
    --audio clone.wav --reference reference/ref_audio_embedding.bin
./build/test_transformer --model models/qwen3-tts-0.6b-f16.gguf \
    --ref-dir reference/
./build/test_decoder --tokenizer models/qwen3-tts-tokenizer-f16.gguf \
    --codes reference/speech_codes.bin --reference reference/decoded_audio.bin

# End-to-end Python vs C++ comparison
uv run python scripts/compare_e2e.py

# Generate deterministic reference data from Python
uv run python scripts/generate_deterministic_reference.py
```

### Test Results (F16 model)

- Prefill logits: cosine similarity = 0.99999994 with Python reference
- Codebook 0 match rate: 81% (frame-level exact match)
- Codebooks 1-4: ~84% match rate
- Audio output is perceptually equivalent; low waveform correlation is expected due to autoregressive divergence from F16 precision
